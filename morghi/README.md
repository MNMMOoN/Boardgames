# Morghi – A Simple & Nasty Online Card Game

**Morghi** is a fast, light-hearted, and slightly mean card game about chickens, eggs, foxes, and betrayal.

The goal is brutally simple:  
**Be the first player to score 3 chickens.**

Everything else is just suffering, stealing, and petty revenge.

## 🎯 Win Condition

First player to collect **3 chickens** wins.  
Chickens are permanent — once you have them, nobody can take them away.
